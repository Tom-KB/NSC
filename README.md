## History
This is the second version of the library, it was created in **July 2024**.  
It’s not thoroughly documented, as I mainly built it as a support tool for my other project, [NSCpp](#ADDLINK).  
Feel free to use it if you find it useful. It may receive occasional updates, but mainly for **bug fixes**—no new features are planned.

## Features
NSC is designed to simplify server/client creation and management.  
Here’s a list of features provided by the library:
 - **IPv4** and **IPv6** support
 - **TCP** and **UDP** communications protocols
 - ***Message framing*** for TCP
 - **Domain Name resolution**
 - An **event** system
 - **Windows** and **Linux** support

## Usage example
You can find a *basic* chat application example—supporting **TCP** or **UDP** and **IPv4** or **IPv6**—in the [examples folder](examples/).  
You can also find a `.a` and `.lib` of the last version of NSC inside the [static library's folder](static-library/).

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome.  
Feel free to improve this project by fixing or reporting any bugs you find.
